# 👋 Hi, I'm Gabriel Rodriguez

🎓 **Computer Science Student | Machine Learning Architect | Data Science Enthusiast**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Data Science at Cal State Fullerton. My passion lies in building intelligent systems that solve real world problems using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

## 🚀 Projects

- 🎗️ **Breast Cancer T-Stage Classifier (Multimodal 2.5D CNN)**
  
  This project presents a **multimodal** approach to breast cancer T-stage classification, integrating structured clinical variables, radiomic features, and 3D breast MRI (DICOM) data within a unified framework. I **co-   authored a research paper** and **led a team of three students**, overseeing model design, experimentation, and evaluation.
  MRI volumes were processed using a **MONAI-based medical imaging pipeline**, incorporating **region-of-interest selection**, **spatial resampling**, and **intensity normalization** to ensure consistency across           patients and imaging protocols. For modeling, we employed a **late-fusion 2.5D convolutional neural network** with a **ResNet backbone**, stacking neighboring slices to capture volumetric context while preserving the    efficiency of 2D convolutions. Uitilization of the 2.5D CNN exhibited strong late stage tumor analysis enhancing **T-stage 3 recall to 87%** while achieving a **97% F1-score on T-stage 4 tumors**.

- 🧠 **MRI Brain Tumor Classifier**
  
  A **convolutional neural network (CNN)** built with **PyTorch** and **OpenCV** to classify glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI scans. Attained **89% accuracy** and **90% recall** across tumor-positive     cases. Leveraged **Explainable AI (XAI)** methods such as **Grad-CAM** for model inteprebaility and clinical trust.

- 🔍 **Diabetes Prediction Model**
  
  An **artificial neural network (ANN)** trained on **electronic medical records (EMR)** to predict diabetes with **80% accuracy** and **92% recall**. Utilized **Pandas**, **PyTorch**, and **Scikit-learn** for **feature   engineering**, **data preprocessing**, and **model architecture**.

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

I'm currently developing a spontaneous retinal venous pulsation (SVP) segmentation model using a handheld-device fundus imaging dataset. This project focuses on computer vision and medical image segmentation techniques to extract SVP patterns, with potential applications in non-invasive intracranial pressure assessment and ophthalmic diagnostics.
