# 👋 Hi, I'm Gabriel Rodriguez

🎓 **Computer Science Student | Machine Learning Architect | Data Science Enthusiast**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Data Science at Cal State Fullerton. My passion lies in building intelligent systems that solve real world problems using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

## 🚀 Projects That Define Me

- 🧠 **MRI Brain Tumor Classifier**  (In Progress)
  A **convolutional neural network (CNN)** built with **PyTorch** and **OpenCV** to classify glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI scans. Attained **89% accuracy** and **90% recall** across tumor-positive cases. Leveraged **Explainable AI (XAI)** methods such as **Grad-CAM** for model inteprebaility and clinical trust.

- 🔍 **Diabetes Prediction Model**  
  An **artificial neural network (ANN)** trained on **electronic medical records (EMR)** to predict diabetes with **80% accuracy** and **92% recall**. Utilized **Pandas**, **PyTorch**, and **Scikit-learn** for **feature engineering**, **data preprocessing**, and **model architecture**. 

## 🧰 Technical Toolbox

**Languages**: Python, SQL  
**Libraries**: PyTorch, Torchvision, OpenCV, MONAI, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
**Concepts**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Data Preprocessing, Agile Methodologies
**Tools**: CUDA, Git/GitHub, PyCharm, Visual Studio, JupyterLab, Google Colab

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

I'm currently leading a team to engineer a breast cancer tumor stage classifier using the TNM grading system with the Data Science & Machine Learning Club at Cal State Fullerton. Developing a **mulitmodal 2.5-Dimensional CNN** employing **MONAI** for medical image processing, augmentation, and **3D deep learning**.
