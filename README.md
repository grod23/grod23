# 👋 Hi, I'm Gabriel Rodriguez

🎓 **Computer Science Student | Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | Data Science Enthusiast**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Data Science at Cal State Fullerton. My passion lies in building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

## 🚀 Projects That Define Me

- 🧠 **MRI Brain Tumor Classifier**  (In Progress)
  A convolutional neural network (CNN) built with PyTorch and OpenCV to classify glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI scans. Includes advanced preprocessing like histogram equalization and data augmentation.

- 🔍 **Diabetes Prediction Model**  
  An artificial neural network (ANN) trained on patient medical data to predict diabetes with 80% accuracy and 92% recall. Focused on feature engineering and diagnostic sensitivity.

## 🧰 Technical Toolbox

**Languages**: Python, R  
**Libraries**: PyTorch, Torchvision, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
**Concepts**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Data Preprocessing, Agile, Scrum  
**Tools**: CUDA, Git/GitHub, PyCharm, Visual Studio, JupyterLab, Google Colab

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

I'm currently leading a team to engineer a breast cancer tumor stage classifier using the TNM grading system with the Data Science & Machine Learning Club at Cal State Fullerton. My focus is on feature engineering, model selection, and cross-validation.
